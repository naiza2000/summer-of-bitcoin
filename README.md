# summer-of-bitcoin

I am in the initial stages of learning bitcoin and hence I would be updating the list of resources I will go through to understand this fascinating system in a better way:
1. [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
2. [The incomplete history of Bitcoin Development](https://b10c.me/blog/004-the-incomplete-history-of-bitcoin-development/)
3.




### Important concepts:

1. `Strongest chain` is NOT the same as the `longest chain` : <br> 
If every block were built using the same amount of Proof Of Work, the `longest chain` would, in fact, be the strongest chain. However, in Bitcoin, amount of POW can vary between the blocks, hence the `longest chain` is not same as the `strongest chain`. _(Operational since July 2010)_

### Possible attacks
1. `Finney Attack` :  Early Bitcoin user Hal Finney discovered this attack and described it: "Suppose the attacker is generating blocks occasionally. in each block he generates, he includes a transfer from address A to address B, both of which he controls.<br>
"To cheat you, when he generates a block, he doesn't broadcast it. Instead, he runs down to your store and makes a payment to your address C with his address A. You wait a few seconds, don't hear anything, and transfer the goods. He broadcasts his block now, and his transaction will take precedence over yours."

### Important events in Bitcoin:
1. `Genesis block` was mined with a timestamp of Jan 9th in 2009.
2. Merging `P2SH` proposal : allows the receiver of a transaction to specify the script needed to spend it.
3. `Unexpected hardfork` in 2013.
4.
